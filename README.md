**Detecting Algae/Cyanobacteria blooms in Washington Lakes with Satellite Imagery**

Tony Cannistra, for University of Washington's [CSE 546](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse546/17au/) course. 

Development ongoing. Started on Mac, moved to Linux, so the most up-to-date `environment.yml` is `environment_linux.yml`, which you should use (`conda env create --file environment_linux.yml`). 

Notebooks in `/experiments`, data currently in S3.
